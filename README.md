## Issues

Issues must be reported to dev team and they will be corrected soon as possible.

Some systems have a chance of false positive, always try to analyze the player before applying any ban.

## Obsolescence

Some modules are probably out of date and will not be updated, so interested parties should improve those that contain false postitives or no longer work.
